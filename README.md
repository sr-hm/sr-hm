You've reached Sil Hamilton's GitHub repository. Take a look around both here and at [my website](https://srhm.ca/).

I'm a graduate student pursuing a Master's in the digital humanities (think compsci/literature) at McGill University. 

I study emergent LLM behaviour, cultural simulacra, and narrative grammars in their modern form. If you'd like to collaborate or discuss machine learning's role in the arts, please reach me at [my email](me@srhm.ca) or IRC (`srhm` on Libera).
